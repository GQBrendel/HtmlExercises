						<p> The Scream (Norwegian: Skrik) is the popular name given to each of four versions of a composition,
						created as both paintings and pastels, by Norwegian Expressionist artist Edvard Munch between 1893 and 1910.
						The German title Munch gave these works is Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature). 
						The works show a figure with an agonized expression against a landscape with a tumultuous orange sky.
						Arthur Lubow has described The Scream as "an icon of modern art, a Mona Lisa for our time."</p>
						<p>
						Edvard Munch created the four versions in various media. The National Gallery in Oslo, Norway, 
						holds one of two painted versions (1893, shown here). The Munch Museum holds 
						the other painted version (1910, see gallery, below) and a pastel version from 1893. 
						These three versions have not traveled for years.</p>
